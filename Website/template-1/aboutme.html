    I was born and raised in Reno Nevada. and developed my passion for filmmaking at an early age. 
    From a young age I knew I wanted to be in the film industry. As I grew up those passions filtered 
    into my studies at the Reynolds School of Journalism. Here I graduated with one of two degrees. My
    second degree is in Cultural Anthropology, while studying anthropology I learned more about how to 
    approach documenting culture and the rich stories that come from such diversity.

  <p>
    While pursuing my education I worked on my technical skill set in both a professional and hobbyist 
    setting. I have posted videos on my personal YouTube channel, Pearl Films, and assessed others in 
    their YouTube channels. In the professional workspace I worked for the University of Nevada Reno
    marketing and Communication department. I developed the Here at UNR series. Which is currently sitting 
    at over 40,000 views on Instagram.

    I am trained on a variety of equipment from low end to industry standard. I am an out of the box thinker, 
    you give constraints I will work magic within them. I love storytelling through images. Every person and 
    even art on a wall creates its own story and purpose. If anything you have found on this site inspires you, 
    please reach out to collaborate. Stay tuned for updates on film projects I hope to create in the near future.
